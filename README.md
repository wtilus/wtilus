I have a strong passion for cybersecurity and cloud technology. I enjoy solving complex problems through hands-on projects that strengthen my skills and deepen my understanding of secure IT environments. From setting up domain controllers to configuring firewalls and detecting threats, each project in this portfolio reflects my commitment to learning, improving, and building practical solutions.
